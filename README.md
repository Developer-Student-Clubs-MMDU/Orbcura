# Orbcura

## NOTE : Prototype named as --> app-release.apk above !!

### Brief about the Idea - Orbcura
 Orbcura is a mobile app for visually impaired people to help them conduct their day to day tasks effectively. Often mobile apps have poor accessibility options. While people who are not impaired easily enjoy the luxuries, impaired people often struggle to use these apps. In short, we are building an app which extends the functionalities and accessibility options of apps which are used daily like UPI Payments, Image Description, etc. So that, impaired people are able to take the advantage of these functionalities

### Opportunities
How is it different from other solutions?
 TalkBack is an accessibility feature incorporated into Android smartphones that allows
visually impaired people to engage with their devices via touch gestures. But, this feature
only provides navigation. Our app provides complete integration to most used apps for
efficient usage.
 VoiceOver is an accessibility feature on Apple devices that gives audio explanations and
spoken feedback. But, this requires the apps to actually implement these accessibility
options. Not all the apps implement these. Our app provides integrations to the app which
do not even implement these.
USP of Orbcura
 Thus, the unique selling proposition (USP) of the idea is the extension of accessibility
features outside the allowed domains.

### Tech Stack
 Flutter for building mobile app faster but efficiently.<br/>
 System accessibility options for reading the screen text and performing automated activities.<br/>
 Firebase for storing basic user information and to handle authentication.<br/>
 Google Cloud and Google Text to speech API's for voice and text features.<br/>
 Gemini API for providing descriptions of images and summarization of messages<br/>
